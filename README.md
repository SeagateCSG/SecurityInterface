Features
========

Presently, SecurityInterface has a whopping one class: `KSPasswordField`. It:

* Shows the password in plain text on-demand
* On the basis that password visibility is likely being toggled for editing, makes the field the first responder
* Automatically cleans up likely unwanted whitespace when pasting or dragging in passwords

Questions about the code should be left as issues at https://github.com/karelia/SecurityInterface or message me on Twitter.

Thanks to [Sebastian](https://github.com/lightforce) for the example project.

Dependencies
============

None beyond AppKit. Probably works back to OS X v10.2 if you were so inclined

Usage
=====

1. Add `KSPasswordField.h` and `KSPasswordField.m` to your project. Ideally, make this repo a submodule, but hey, it's your codebase, do whatever you feel like.
2. In Interface Builder, create a regular `NSSecureTextField` and then set its custom class to be `KSPasswordField`. You can also instantiate `KSPasswordField` directly like any other control
3. Whitespace-cleanup comes for free; no extra work required
4. To control showing the password, `KSPasswordField` has the following methods:
	* `@property(nonatomic) BOOL showsText;`
	* `- (IBAction)showText:(id)sender;`
	* `- (IBAction)secureText:(id)sender;`
	* `- (IBAction)toggleTextShown:(id)sender;`

I generally prefer to hook up a checkbox (`NSButton`) straight to the `toggleTextShown:` action
